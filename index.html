  <br>
  <span> Our first night in Mexico City we ordered Sopes, a traditional fried corn cake originating in the central and southern region of the country. These minature ground maize cakes are typically served as a vessel with toppings, like chicken or meat.

  <h1> Chapulines in El Centro </h1>
  <img src="chapulines.jpg" alt="grasshoppers">
  <p> Seasoned, deep-fried grasshoppers are a common snack across the city. I won't deny that it took me a few days to finally try these critters but I'm happy I did because they're crunchy and delicious.   </p>

  <p> Originally brought by the Lebanese immigrants to Mexico in the 19th century, Al pastor is spit-roasted pork visible on almost every street corner. It's one of Mexico City's signature dishes.  </p>

  <h1> Churrrrros! </h1>
  <img src="churros.jpg" alt="dessert">
  <p> One afternoon after walking what felt like a half-marathon, we came to a locally beloved churro café established in 1935. Churros are common not only in Mexico but around Latin America, and typically paired with creamy Hot Chocolate as the ideal dessert. </p>
